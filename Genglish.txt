Hey
Love
Love lifestyle
Clean
In their stars then the rivers falling from the sky
Like a cold in my eyes
Just more time so I’ve been ‘till over one line
Incurs this over with a small dry
And I can taste it in my long fill my first memory
‘Cause the planets has still can talk to me
Put my hands in the air feel it’s energy
Meeting together
And I breathe, and I sleep
Into hells, into deep
In the see, in the ?
And over money so
Liking gang
The silence of the world is in the flames
I’ve been it over 
Dance, living left
But
The conscience changes as well as moon
The second leaves the room
I can feel the change in the air up a chemicals
And the silence becomes a tune
