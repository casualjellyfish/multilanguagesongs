You know I'm just a flight away
If you want it, you could take a private plane
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain
You know that I can see right through you
I can read your mind, I can read your mind
What you wanna do?
It's written all over your face, times two
'Cause I can read your mind, I can read your mind
I can hear your thoughts like a melody
Listen while you talk when you're fast asleep
You stay on the phone just to hear me breathe
(On repeat)
(You know I got a lot to say)
(All these voices in the background of my brain)
