Hey, man do you think you could lend me a bit of cash?
Twelve-foot two bottles of red wine ten-foot bands of hash
You could buy some K and we could make it through the night
Something in my head has made me scared of thoughts inside
I’ve had an awful day and I’m feeling sorry for myself
Don’t tell me to stop I didn’t come to you for help
Just to get a loan to buy myself some wine and beer
Fill this hole of mine and let my troubles disappear
Murder city hella class in the night
Heavy hand serves nicely when the pelican arrives
Hall Fast lights act as candles for the blanche
When desire for the use of double-bedding comes to mind
So we could get a bit of house, sit and embellish the night
Let the liquor and the wine be the flicker in a glass frame
Visited the posts that reside in my cage
Saying there’s “4, 99” be the red flow in my veins
Life up in the city kinda pricy
But if you’re feeling lucky there’s a couple mecca bingos
Win a bit of copper dough, spend it on a bottle go
Linger by the wide-eyed in need of a lighter (time’s up, sirs)
I need-a some guidance
So why would the girl so mighty delight in my suffering
Want to show the kingdom, driven by my villa tune
Only up and I’m sad and I’m lonely again
I said: hey man!
Take a walk on the wild side 
Hey man! 
Take a walk on the wild side
No, and Chill man, hey man, hey man
Take a walk on the wild side 
Hey man, take a walk on the wild side (and the moon man says)
