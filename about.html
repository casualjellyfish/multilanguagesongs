<p class="title">About</p>
<p class="about">Multilingual speaking communities have always been present in the world, <br>due to colonisation and migrations, or as dialects coexisting with other languages.<br> While in our everyday lives it could be inconvenient to mix different languages,<br> poetry is a realm where instant communication is not necessary, and when it turns into music, different languages can work together to create new sounds, new meanings.
    <br><br>
    Multilingual lyrics are also a way for artists to express their identity and 
    their influences, <br>they are a testament to the multiculturality of our society.
    <br>
    <br>
    This website is a collection of multilingual songs of different origins, which can be added to, modified, creating visual weavings and longer texts that interlace with each other.
