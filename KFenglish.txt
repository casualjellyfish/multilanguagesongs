You know
Everything you need I got
It’s a over
For discover
It’s slay
When you want I’m ready for slay, babe
When you want I’m ready for slay, babe
When you want I’m ready for slay, babe
When you want I’m ready for slay, babe
You are my fresh light
I need a hurt time
I get the pleasure
How I get now?
You are my fresh light
I need a hurt time
I get the pleasure
How I get now?
For you too my party
I got just sound
For you too my party
I got just sound
Give me your sugar
Shy wondering
So clean
Shake your little
You are my fresh light
I need a hurt time
I get the pleasure
How I get now?
You are my fresh light
I need a hurt time
I get the pleasure
How I get now?
For you too my party
I got just sound
For you too my party
I got just sound
City
You are my fresh light
I need a hurt time
Thinkin' in pleasure
Get party to my world, I've been here
Get party to my world, here, here
Get party to my world, here, here
To my, to my world, here, here
I got so hot, fuck me
