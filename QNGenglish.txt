When someone tries recalling the past
And the love that he once thought could last
Saudade can feel pretty good
He did all that he could
He just remembers the best
But if he dreams the same dream each night
That someone he once loved has come back
Can be oh so cruel
It makes you bend to it’s rule
Because this suffering won’t pass
