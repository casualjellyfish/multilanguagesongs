I’ve heard it all before, I’ve heard it all before
I’ve heard it all before, I’ve heard it all before
I’ve heard it all before, I’ve heard it all before
I’ve heard it all before, I’ve heard it all before
I’ve heard it all before, I’ve heard it all before
I’ve heard it all before, I’ve heard it all before
I don’t wanna hear
I don’t wanna know
Please don’t say you’re sorry
I’ve heard it all before
And I can take care of myself
I don’t wanna hear
I don’t wanna know
Please don’t say ‘forgive me’
I’ve seen it all before
And I can’t take it anymore
You’re not half the man you think you are
Save your words because you’ve gone too far
I’ve listened to your lies and all your stories
(I’ve listened to your stories)
You’re not half the man you’d like to be
I don’t wanna hear
I don’t wanna know
Please don’t say you’re sorry
I’ve heard it all before
And I can take care of myself
I don’t wanna hear
I don’t wanna know
Please don’t say ‘forgive me’
I’ve seen it all before
And I can’t take it anymore
Don’t explain yourself cause talk is cheap
There’s more important things than hearing you speak
We stayed because I made it so convenient
Don’t explain yourself you’ll never see
Forgive me
Sorry
I’ve heard it all before, I’ve heard it all before
I’ve heard it all before, I’ve heard it all before
I’ve heard it all before, I’ve heard it all before
I’ve heard it all before, I’ve heard it all before
I’ve heard it all before, I’ve heard it all before
I’ve heard it all before, I’ve heard it all before
I’ve heard it all before, I’ve heard it all before
I’ve heard it all before, I’ve heard it all before
I don’t wanna hear
I don’t wanna know
Please don’t say you’re sorry
I’ve heard it all before
And I can take care of myself
I don’t wanna hear
I don’t wanna know
Please don’t say ‘forgive me’
